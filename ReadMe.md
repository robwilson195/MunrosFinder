## Scottish Munros App
Lab Duration: 180 minutes

### Learning Objectives
Be able to create a web app with a modular front-end
Be able to implement reusable and nested views
Brief
Your task is to create an app that displays a list of all the Scottish Munros. (A Munro is a mountain over 3,000 feet). Use the Munros API to make a request to get the data.

## MVP
Display a list of the mountains.
Views should be reused where ever possible.
Any views that are created dynamically should be nested within a wrapper view to avoid app.js having too many responsibilities.

### Extensions
Allows a user to filter Scottish Munros by region. When a user selects a region from the drop-down, the mountains for that region, with a selection of their information, should be displayed.

Add a select that contains a list of regions and allows a user to filters displayed list of mountains by region.
